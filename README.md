# Decidim â€“ consultation platform

The main objective of the Project is to launch a new digital service by the City of Warsaw in the form of an online Platform, integrated with other selected urban digital solutions, ready to support consultative processes carried out by the City of Warsaw.

Decidim KS is a platform designed to facilitate public participation and engagement in decision-making processes. Through this system, citizens can actively contribute their opinions, feedback, and ideas on various issues and projects. They can participate in surveys and discussions, providing valuable input to inform policies, plans and initiatives.

This is the open-source repository for decidim-warsaw-ks, based on [Decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim).

## Modules

The software is based on the Decidim 0.24.3 solution. It is a system that includes ready-made modules. During the development work, additional modules were produced, extending the functionality of existing modules or adding new modules to the system. All modules are an integral part of the platform, stored in the GIT repository and installed together as one application.

cd decidim-warsaw-ks
bundle install
```

## Setting up the application

You will need to do some steps before having the app working properly once you've deployed it:

1. Open a Rails console in the server: `bundle exec rails console`
2. Create a System Admin user:
```ruby
user = Decidim::System::Admin.new(email: <email>, password: <password>, password_confirmation: <password>)
user.save!
```
3. Visit `<your app url>/system` and login with your system admin credentials
4. Create a new organization. Check the locales you want to use for that organization, and select a default locale.
5. Set the correct default host for the organization, otherwise the app will not work properly. Note that you need to include any subdomain you might be using.
6. Fill the rest of the form and submit it.

You're good to go!
